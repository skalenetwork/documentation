= Block Rotation Specification

* SKALED maintains not an exact amount of blocks set in the config, but at least this amount.
* Config parameter _rotate_after_block_ sets the number of blocks after which skaled rotates 1 out of 4 databases. As a result, skaled maintains a minimum of rotate_after_block * 4, and a maximum rotate_after_block * 5 – 1 blocks.
* Database rotation happens just before a new block is inserted.

=== Mechanisms

Rotation is performed in the following DBs: `blocks_and_extras`

This database contains:

* Blocks
* Transactions and their receipts
* Log blooms
* “best” and “chainStart”

link:https://github.com/ethereum/aleth/blob/master/doc/database_layout.rst[See database_layout.rst]

Directory with DB contains subdirectories:

1. 0.db
2. 1.db
3. 2.db
4. 3.db
5. 4.db

These dirs are created automatically.

On rotation, one directory is deleted and re-created. The order of rotation is `0->4->3->2->1->0`

The “current” piece for writing is marked with the key:

```
const std::string current_piece_mark_key =
    "ead48ec575aaa7127384dee432fc1c02d9f6a22950234e5ecf59f35ed9f6e78d"
```
with an empty value.

On rotation, this key is killed in old current piece and is created in new current piece.

On start, it's searched in all pieces.

Insert/update operations go to current piece.

Read operations are performed in all pieces from most recent to least recent, until found.

Kill operations are performed in all pieces.
