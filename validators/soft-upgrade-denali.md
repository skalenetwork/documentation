## Mainnet Soft Upgrade 

### Important notes

1.  Make sure you updated your geth node to `1.10.1` version with Berlin hard-fork support.

2.  Make sure iptables-persistent, btrfs-progs, lsof, lvm2, psmisc packages are installed (`dpkg -l | grep <package>`).

3.  You can install btrfs-progs, lsof, lvm2, psmisc packages using the following commands:
    ```shell
    sudo apt install btrfs-progs lsof lvm2 psmisc
    ```

4.  You can install iptables-persistent using the following commands:
    ``` shell
    echo iptables-persistent iptables-persistent/autosave_v4 boolean true | sudo debconf-set-selections
    echo iptables-persistent iptables-persistent/autosave_v6 boolean true | sudo debconf-set-selections
    sudo apt install iptables-persistent -y
    ```

5.  Make sure you installed `1.27.4` docker-compose version. 

6.  After docker installation make sure that the `live-restore` option
    is enabled in `/etc/docker/daemon.json`. See more info in the [docker docs](https://docs.docker.com/config/containers/live-restore/).  

7.  If you have any issues you can save the logs using `skale logs dump` command.  
    It's also useful to check logs from node-cli `skale cli logs` from docker plugin `/var/log/docker-lvmpy/lvmpy.log` if there are any issues.

8.  You should run skale commands as superuser.

9.  skale_sla container will be removed because it's deprecated for now.

10. Logs from removed containers are placed inside `.skale/log/.removed_containers`.

11. Before `skale node update` make sure that your attached storage isn't mounted.

12. IMA agent is disabled for now. Please make sure that DISABLE_IMA=True is set in .env file before `skale node update`.

13. Don't forget to specify ENV_TYPE=mainnet in .env.

14. SGX enclave version is changed, be sure to pull the correct version `sgxwallet_release:1.70.0-stable.0`. You should use https://github.com/skalenetwork/sgxwallet/blob/develop/docs/backup-procedure.md#upgrade-sgxwallet set of instructions to upgrade it.

15. Make sure you uploaded valid certificates. Whole chain should be uploaded as `-c` in `skale ssl upload`. The order of the chain is important too. More info can be found here https://www.itsfullofstars.de/2016/02/verify-certificate-chain-with-openssl/

### Manager ABI

For SKALE Validator CLI initialization use SKALE Manager ABI:

`https://raw.githubusercontent.com/skalenetwork/skale-network/master/releases/mainnet/skale-manager/1.8.0/skale-manager-1.8.0-mainnet-abi.json`

### Update geth node

Make sure you updated geth node to `1.10.1` version with Berlin hard-fork support.

### Recharge validator wallet

#### Download new Validator CLI binary

Make sure `VERSION_NUM` is `1.2.0`

**Terminal Command:**

```shell
VERSION_NUM=[VERSION_NUM] && sudo -E bash -c "curl -L https://github.com/skalenetwork/validator-cli/releases/download/$VERSION_NUM/sk-val-$VERSION_NUM-`uname -s`-`uname -m` >  /usr/local/bin/sk-val"
```

#### Apply executable permissions to the binary

**Terminal Command:**

```shell
chmod +x /usr/local/bin/sk-val
```

#### Get SKALE Manager contracts info and set the endpoint

**Note**: Be sure to setup Geth with the following JSON-RPC transports: `geth --http --http.api eth,web3`.

**Terminal Command:**

```shell
sk-val init -e [ENDPOINT] -c [ABI] --wallet [software/ledger]
```

Required arguments:

-   `--endpoint/-e` - RPC endpoint of the node in the network where SKALE manager is deployed (`http` or `https`)
                    Example: <https://my.geth.node/..>.

-   `--contracts-url/-c` - URL to SKALE Manager contracts ABI and addresses

-   `-w/--wallet` - Type of the wallet that will be used for signing transactions (software or ledger)

#### Setup wallet

##### Software wallet

If you want to use software wallet you need to save the private key into a file.

Replace `[YOUR PRIVATE KEY]` with your wallet private key

**Terminal Command:**

```shell
echo [YOUR PRIVATE KEY] > ./pk.txt
```

##### Ledger wallet

If you want to use Ledger you should install the ETH ledger application and initialize the device with `setup-ledger` command.

**Terminal Command:**

```shell
sk-val wallet setup-ledger --address-index [ADDRESS_INDEX] --keys-type [KEYS_TYPE]
```

Required arguments:

-   `--address-index` - Index of the address to use (starting from `0`)
-   `--keys-type` - Type of the Ledger keys (live or legacy)

> Make sure that you enabled contracts data sending on ledger ETH application. Otherwise transactions won't work

#### Recharge wallet

For more information visit [Self recharging wallet](/validators/self-recharging-wallets).

`ETH_AMOUNT` should be 1 ETH

Using ledger wallet:

```shell
sk-val srw recharge ETH_AMOUNT
```

Using software wallet:

```shell
sk-val srw recharge ETH_AMOUNT --pk-file PATH_TO_PK
```

**Note:** Make sure validator account (which you specified as `pk-file` or `ledger`) has at least 1.5 ETH.

### Update sgx wallet

Update your sgx wallet to `1.70.0-stable.0` using upgrade procedure with different enclave version.

For more information visit https://github.com/skalenetwork/sgxwallet/blob/develop/docs/backup-procedure.md#upgrade-sgxwallet

### Install SKALE Node CLI

#### Download the SKALE Node CLI binary

Make sure `VERSION_NUM` is `1.1.0`

**Terminal Command:**

```shell
VERSION_NUM=[VERSION_NUM] && sudo -E bash -c "curl -L https://github.com/skalenetwork/skale-node-cli/releases/download/$VERSION_NUM/skale-$VERSION_NUM-`uname -s`-`uname -m` >  /usr/local/bin/skale"

```

#### Make the SKALE Node CLI binary executable

**Terminal Command:**

```shell
sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/skale
```

### Update node using skale node update

#### Change directory
```shell
cd  ~ && vi .env
```

#### Update .env

Make sure the following options are set:

```shell
DOCKER_LVMPY_STREAM=1.0.1-stable.1
MANAGER_CONTRACTS_ABI_URL=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/skalenetwork/skale-network/master/releases/mainnet/skale-manager/1.8.0/skale-manager-1.8.0-mainnet-abi.json
IMA_CONTRACTS_ABI_URL=https://skale-contracts.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/mainnet-ima/ima.json
CONTAINER_CONFIGS_STREAM=1.2.0
FILEBEAT_HOST=filebeat.mainnet.skalenodes.com:5000
DISABLE_IMA=True
ENV_TYPE=mainnet
MONITORING_CONTAINERS=True
```

#### Ensure packages

Make sure the btrfs-progs, iptables-persistent, lsof, lvm2, psmisc package are installed on your machine:

```shell
dpkg -l | grep btrfs-progs
dpkg -l | grep iptables-persistent
dpkg -l | grep lsof
dpkg -l | grep lvm2
dpkg -l | grep psmisc
```

Make sure docker-compose version is `1.27.4`:

```shell
docker-compose --version
```

Also make sure your attached storage block device specified by `DISK_MOUNTPOINT` isn't mounted.

#### Perform update

Run skale node update:
```shell
skale node update .env
```

#### Setup SSL certs

##### Set domain name

```shell
skale node set-domain -d DOMAIN_NAME --yes
```

##### Upload SSL

```shell
skale ssl upload -c PATH_TO_CERT_FILE -k PATH_TO_KEY_FILE
```

You can use `-f` option to override existing certificates.

##### Check SSL certificates

To check SSL certificates you can use https://github.com/skalenetwork/helper-scripts/blob/develop/ssl_check.py to run simple web server.

Script can be executed using `python3 ssl_check.py PATH_TO_KEY_FILE PATH_TO_PK`

And then check the SSL connection using openssl:

```shell
 openssl s_client -connect  DOMAIN_NAME:443 -verify_return_error
```

The following line indicates that SSL configuration is ok.

```shell
    Verify return code: 0 (ok)
```

Note that by default script serve on `443`. So it should be opened by cloud provider firewall to be able to connect externally using openssl.
