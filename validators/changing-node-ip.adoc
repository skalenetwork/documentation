= Changing a Node IP

You can't change your node IP address, but what's possible is to remove the node with the incorrect/old IP address and register a new node under the correct/new IP while keeping the old SGX key. Please contact the core team before proceeding for further guidance.

[NOTE]
It's recommended to use a **permanent IP that can dynamically point to a node's machine IP (for example, elastic IP)** so you can update machines if needed without having to change the IP recorded in SKALE Manager during node registration.

[IMPORTANT]
If you must change your node IP in SKALE Manager, you must perform a node exit and re-registration between the time after getBounty is called and before 72 hours (3 days) elapses in the next month. Also, performing a node exit could be expensive to the node operator if it's currently supporting SKALE Chains.

To perform a node exit, and register a new machine and IP:

1. Be sure to backup SKALE Node and SGX Wallet.
2. Be sure you have your SGX Backup key.
3. Execute `skale exit start` on the exiting node during the time window between getBounty and 72 hours from the UTC start of the month.
4. Verify the exit process by executing `skale exit status`. (You don't need to wait for exit to finalize)
5. Create a new node machine (`skale node init .env`, `skale wallet info`).
6. From the old machine, move your node address funds to the new node wallet address `skale wallet send [new_address] [amount]`.
7. Unlink the old node address `sk-val validator unlink-address [OLD_NODE_ADDRESS] `
8. Link the new node to the validator ID `skale node signature [VALIDATOR_ID]`, `sk-val validator link-address [NEW_NODE_ADDRESS] [NEW_NODE_SIGNATURE]`
9. Register the node with under the new IP `skale node register --name [NODE_NAME] --ip [NODE_IP] --port [PORT]`.

To perform a node exit, keep the original node machine and its data and update the IP, follow these steps (NOT RECOMMENDED):

1. Perform the general node exit procedure steps 1 and 2 above.
2. Be sure you have securely saved the sgx_key_name before moving to step 3.
3. Remove .skale directory, remove all old containers, volumes, etc
4. Do skale node init again.
5. Go to `~/.skale/node_data/node_config.json` and replace `sgx_key_name` field with the old one.
6. Link the node to the validator ID again.
7. Register node with a new IP.
