= Block Rotation

SKALE Chain Block rotation is set by the _rotate_after_block_ parameter in static_schain_params.json. The current default value is 1,024,000 blocks and is tuned by performance of consensus, skaled, and node storage.

Each SKALE Chain maintains a minimum to maximum number of blocks, currently 4,096,000 to 5,119,999 blocks.

Rotation is performed across 4 databases. Each database contains:

* blocks
* transactions and their receipts
* log blooms
* "best" (lastBlockHash, best block of the canonical chain)
* "chainStart" (firstBlockHash, used when full chain isn't available, for example after snapshot import)
