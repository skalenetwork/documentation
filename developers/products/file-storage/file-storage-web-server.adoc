# File Storage Web3 Server

SKALE Chain nodes run a special NGINX Webserver that provides read-only access to each file uploaded using SKALE Chain Filestorage.

To access the file, use the following URL convention:

`http(s):/NODE_DOMAIN_NAME/SKALE_CHAIN_ID/FILESTORAGE_FULL_PATH`


Example:

```shell
https://node1.validator.com/fluffy-marsupial/77333Da3492C4BBB9CCF3EA5BB63D6202F86CDA8/directoryA/random_text.txt
```
