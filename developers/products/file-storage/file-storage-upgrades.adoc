The SKALE Chain owner can upgrade pre-deployed Filestorage contracts. The Filestorage contracts uses OpenZeppelin's Upgrade framework.

== Pre-deployed Addresses

Proxy Admin: `0xD3001000000000000000000000000000000000D3`

Proxy Contract: `0xD4001000000000000000000000000000000000D4`

Filestorage: `0x69362535ec535F0643cBf62D16aDeDCAf32Ee6F7`

== Upgrade procedure

1. Deploy new Filestroage version on your SKALE Chain.
2. Send upgrade transaction to the pre-deployed Proxy Admin, containing the new address of Filestorage Implementation.
3. Admin calls the pre-deployed Filestorage Proxy contract and passes the new Filestorage address.
4. Proxy now points to the new Filestorage contract.
