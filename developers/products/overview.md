### Products

SKALE Chains come with several tools to make the development of dApps in Web3 cloud easier.

#### ðŸª™ Token/Message Bridge with IMA

To transfer tokens or messages from Ethereum to SKALE chains, or between SKALE Chains, [checkout the Interchain Messaging Agent (IMA)](/developers/products/interchain-messaging-agent/overview.md). IMA allows dApp developers to leverage both BLS threshold signatures, secure enclaves, and a decentralized random selection of validators to transfer tokens and messages between chains. Unlike other bridges, IMA provides dApp developers easy control to map assets on the fly to SKALE chains, and set up different access control policies.

IMA currently supports ETH, ERC20, ERC721, and can support any other standard using the modular IMA MessageProxy framework. 

#### ðŸ“‚ Decentralized Filestorage

To use decentralized storage on your SKALE Chain, [checkout Filestorage](/developers/file-storage.md). Filestorage allows you to upload and access files directly on a SKALE chain. Use it to store images, static HTML, or other files to work with your dApp.
