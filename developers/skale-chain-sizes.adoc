= SKALE Chain Sizes

SKALE Chain sizing is tuned during development and testnets and is set by the schain_allocation.yml file in SKALE Node.

[NOTE]
Initial deployment of SKALE Chains will be Medium size only. Other sizes will be available in later releases.

[NOTE]
Current node storage for each SKALE Chain is allocated to consensus (30%), blockstorage (30%), filestorage (30%), and logs (10%).
