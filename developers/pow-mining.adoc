= PoW Mining for SKALE Chains

This feature is enabled by deploying a SKALE Chain and setting the schain_config of `"externalGasDifficulty": "0x01"`, where the value defines the difficulty required by the end-user to mine for skETH gas. The higher the difficulty is set, the longer your end-user must mine for sufficient skETH gas to conduct a transaction.

Set this high if you require users to wait-authenticate longer for skETH, and set this low if you want users to wait-authenticate more easily to conduct transactions on your SKALE Chain.

Once this value is set, it can't be updated. To set a new value, you must migrate to an updated SKALE Chain with the new difficulty value.
