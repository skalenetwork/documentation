# Overview

## SKALE Network Technology

Our technology is based on BLS threshold signatures, Distributed Key Generation, SGX, and SKALE Consensus (Asynchronous Binary Byzantine Agreement consensus protocol). The following sections document these technologies.

## SKALE Network: Open Source Plan

SKALE Network would be nothing without the open source community - we stand on the shoulders of giants. The majority of our technology is licensed under AGPL, with the exception of skaled which is forked from Ethereum's Aleth and under GPL.
