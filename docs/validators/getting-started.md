## SKALE Validator

The SKALE Network is a high-throughput, low-latency, configurable byzantine fault-tolerant sidechain network for the Ethereum blockchain. Or, in short, an Elastic Sidechain Network.  

The SKALE Network has a set of validators securing the network. Validators provide computation power to the SKALE Network via deploying nodes. The collection of validators and the node(s) they spin up represent the entire validator network that performs work for SKALE Chains (Elastic Sidechain aka SKALE Chain).  
‍  
SKALE Chains in the network are operated by a group of virtualized sub-nodes selected from a subset of nodes (validators) in the network and are run on all or a subset (multi-tenancy) of each node’s computation and storage resources.  

As each node in the network continues to participate in their assigned SKALE Chains, they are awarded bounties based upon their performance at the end of each network epoch. Each node will be monitored by their peer nodes.  
‍  
When an Elastic Sidechain has reached the end of its lifetime, the resources (computation, storage) of its virtualized sub-nodes will be freed so that validator nodes may participate in newly created Elastic Sidechains.
