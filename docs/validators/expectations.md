## Validator Expectations

-   Reliable connection to SKALE Network (low latency, high uptime)  
-   Robust security practices and network architecture
-   Running latest SKALE Node software releases
-   Participation in governance (when applicable)

To encourage proper behavior amongst network participants, SKALE follows a Proof of Stake (POS) system whereby each node must stake a predetermined amount of SKALE tokens to be slashed at the citation of any activity not condoned by the network.  

Activities not approved by the network generally include those which denote a failure to properly participate in each assigned SKALE Chainâ€™s consensus, and maintain uptime and latency standards enforced by the Service Level Agreement (SLA).  

Network SLAs are enforced through an algorithmic peer review system whereby each node is appointed 24 node peers to monitor and log their network participation, uptime, and latency. These metrics will be collected and averaged on the Ethereum mainnet to reward or slash nodes according to their respective performance.
