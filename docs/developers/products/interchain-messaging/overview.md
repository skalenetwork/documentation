### Interchain Messaging Agent

SKALE makes it possible to manage tokens for end users between Ethereum and your SKALE Chain. You can use the Interchain Messaging Agent to transfer ETH, ERC20, ERC721, or Dai to a deposit box on Ethereum, and SKALE will create clones of the token on your SKALE Chain. You can then send the tokens back your end users, and the tokens will be released from the deposit box back to the end user. To learn how to integrate this feature into your dApp, please see the guides below.
