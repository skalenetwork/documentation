## SKALE Faucet

The SKALE Faucet is used to get test ETH needed for your SKALE Chain while using the SKALE devnet. In order to run transactions on the SKALE Chain, you will need to obtain a small about of test ETH. Once the test ETH has been transferred to your account, you can use that account to deploy smart contracts, send transactions, use SKALE Storage, use Interchain Messaging, and perform many other transactions on your SKALE Chain.
