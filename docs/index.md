## Welcome

Thank you for your interest in SKALE! We are in process of developing out our developer and validator documentation, and we are open to feedback.  

### Introduction

SKALE Network is an open-source, fully decentralized, layer 2 scaling network. Nodes in the SKALE Network are placed into SKALE chains in a random, cryptographically secure manner. The nodes work together to run a fast, asynchronous consensus with fast finality. SKALE Network's modular protocol is one of the first of its kind to allow developers to easily provision highly configurable elastic sidechains, which provide the benefits of decentralization without compromising on computation or bandwidth. The result is a decentralized, cost-effective, secure, and easy to use layer 2 scaling environment.
